# Statistical Analysis of COVID-19 Data

Welcome! This repository holds our academic project for the Applied Statistics course with Prof. Arunabha Majumdar. Here, we dig into actual COVID-19 data and use Python (mainly Jupyter Notebooks) to explore what statistics can tell us about the pandemic.

## Project Overview

We worked with real COVID-19 datasets to practice and understand different statistical methods. The project covers everything from basic data cleaning and visualization to hypothesis testing.  
Our main aim: Use statistics to answer practical questions, make sense of the results, and share our findings clearly and reproducibly.

## Repository Structure

- `Visualization/` – The first part of the project. Contains notebooks and code for visualizing the COVID-19 data, including graphs, plots, and general exploratory analysis. The relevant datasets for visualization are included in this folder.
- `Estimations/` – The second part of the project. This folder contains statistical estimations and analyses done on the data, applying various statistical methods. Datasets used for estimation are included here.
- `README.md` – You’re reading it!

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zen-Nightshade/Applied_Stats_Project.git
   cd Applied_Stats_Project
   ```

2. **Install the necessary Python libraries:**  
   (Python 3.7 or newer recommended)
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels jupyter
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then open any notebook from the `Visualization/` or `Estimations/` folders to get started.
